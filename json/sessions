It took us years to develop approaches and processes to scale projects and we are constantly reviewing and working hard on improving ourselves. So, what is next?</p><p>What do we want to do next, what do we want to do better and how do we want to help more people, train developers, create better software and hardware and do good?</p><p>We came up with three areas, that we want to focus on:</p><p>1. In 2018, it is our goal to improve the quality of work of the FOSSASIA organization and contributions in our projects. We believe that the way to move forward is to provide project owners with more responsibilities and ownership. We aim to develop more and more into an organization that provides a framework for projects. Therefore we will continue to develop programs like Codeheat, OpenTechNights, organize meetups, participate in GSoC and GCI. We also plan to cooperate more with other organizations. Why shouldn't we run the OpenTechNights at events around the world and help to bring people together? Why shouldn't we have more OpenTechSummits with partners in China, India and Vietnam?</p><p>2. We have made very good experience with our best practices. We have seen that newcomers can progress very fast if they feel welcome and receive help and guidance from others. After they become participants in our programs many contributors move on to support others as mentors. We also see that contributors have moved to large companies, but still continue to help others in the community. This is wonderful. We want to share our experience and inspire other projects. Therefore, we plan to participate in more events, we will set up a monthly live-cast and we will run a YouTube series on these topics. While a lot of traditional school education still encourages a top-down approach we will focus our attention even more on enabling the community to collaborate on an equal level and follow the idea of sharing ideas and code freely.</p><p>3. A question that any organization and project encounters over time is how to ensure the work and setup is sustainable? What settings do projects need to succeed? While there are many non-profit organizations out there developing Open Technologies and FOSS, we also see that many people are moving on to companies that often focus on proprietary solutions and prevent contributors from continuing their engagement in the Open Tech community due to financial reasons and to support their families. At the same time, we see many projects that would have a great potential to be Open Source and at the same time commercially successful. Therefore we are starting a new dedicated FOSSASIA Accelerator that is specifically for Open Source projects. We invite projects to apply for the accelerator and investors and companies to team up with us. And, think about it, while many startups these days start with an idea, Open Source startups already have a product before any investment has started. So, these are great opportunities!</p><p>The problems in this world are too big. There is a lot of injustice, we are destroying the environment and people are even fighting each others. At FOSSASIA we want to set an example of collaboration across borders and cultures. So, please join us and let's make this a success. I wish everyone a wonderful event full of sharing and new understandings. Let's get inspired to share and learn for each other to build a better world.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<span><p style=\"\">Hong Phuc, originally from Vietnam, lives in\u00a0 between the US, Singapore and Berlin.

Through empirical evidence, both models have been proven to be\neffective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks such as natural language\nprocessing (Wen et al., 2015), speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2015), and\ntext classification (Yang et al., 2016). Conventionally, like most neural\nnetworks, both of the aforementioned RNN variants employ the Softmax function\nas its final output layer for its prediction, and the cross-entropy function\nfor computing its loss. In this paper, we present an amendment to this norm by\nintroducing linear support vector machine (SVM) as the replacement for Softmax\nin the final output layer of a GRU model. Furthermore, the cross-entropy\nfunction shall be replaced with a margin-based function. While there have been\nsimilar studies (Alalshekmubarak &amp; Smith, 2013; Tang, 2013), this proposal is\nprimarily intended for binary classification on intrusion detection using the\n2013 network traffic data from the honeypot systems of Kyoto University.\nResults show that the GRU-SVM model performs relatively higher than the\nconventional GRU-Softmax model. The proposed model reached a training accuracy\nof ~81.54% and a testing accuracy of ~84.15%, while the latter was able to\nreach a training accuracy of ~63.07% and a testing accuracy of ~70.75%. In\naddition, the juxtaposition of these two final output layers indicate that the\nSVM would outperform Softmax in prediction time - a theoretical implication\nwhich was supported by the actual training and testing time in the study.\n</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "A computer scientist focusing on theoretical machine learning, and some of its application to other scientific disciplines.", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3108/photo/ditITEpYai/bd40a2ba-2a36-40ba-8b86-45349e434bf1.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 3108, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3108/icon/eEVUWlFkem/d1777245-a0b2-4bc4-80ff-2baea8ce2596.jpg", "city": "Manila", "name": "Abien Fred Agarap", "speaking_experience": "", "organisation": "Adamson University", "long_biography": "", "heard_from": null, "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3108/small/R2ZjNjQyVG/4a8e2bd1-530d-4d96-942e-5678973875f6.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3108/thumbnail/eDNIZFpIR2/737af1e3-9c4b-41a7-a82a-8125b5eedf9f.jpg"}], "subtitle": "", "language": "", "title": "A Novel Architecture Combining Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN) and L2-Support Vector Machine (L2-SVM)", "track": {"color": "#59f0d5", "font_color": "#000000", "id": 705, "name": "Artificial Intelligence"}, "start_time": "2018-03-22T12:00:00+08:00", "level": "", "comments": "<p>A presentation of my proposed neural network architecture, a research presented to the Department of Computer Science in Adamson University, Manila, Philippines.</p>", "slides": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/temp/ef9608c5-28f0-4ebe-af29-69784129805d/STY2d0p4dW/A_Novel_Architecture_Combining_Gated_Recurrent_Neural_Network_GRNN_and_L2-Support_Vector_Machine_L2-SVM.pdf", "state": "rejected", "microlocation": null, "end_time": "2018-03-22T13:00:00+08:00", "video": null, "audio": null, "signup_url": null, "id": 4333, "long_abstract": ""}, {"session_type": {"length": "00:25", "id": 384, "name": "Keynote"}, "short_abstract": "<p>This talk would cover the ways in which companies are leveraging the concept of event-based (or serverless) engineering for building highly resilient, automated and efficient data science and Machine pipelines.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3114/photo/UFJYKzBCTW/bd08d49e-cb71-4164-89bc-09c74caabfdb.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 3114, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3114/icon/RUY1K1Qza1/b34c8e3b-798d-4732-bd3d-ff91b2d3ee58.jpg", "city": "", "name": "Jalem Raj Rohit", "speaking_experience": "", "organisation": "Episource LLC", "long_biography": "", "heard_from": null, "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3114/small/QjJRMFhybU/2763e3d1-f761-4ce2-926f-4a477fcf6878.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3114/thumbnail/ZlRiQWVtcl/ec8079d7-8061-485e-8d40-b696efb9a0ef.jpg"}], "subtitle": "", "language": "", "title": "Serverless in Data Science", "track": {"color": "#59f0d5", "font_color": "#000000", "id": 705, "name": "Artificial Intelligence"}, "start_time": "2018-03-22T12:00:00+08:00", "level": "", "comments": "", "slides": null, "state": "rejected", "microlocation": null, "end_time": "2018-03-22T13:00:00+08:00", "video": null, "audio": null, "signup_url": null, "id": 4335, "long_abstract": ""}, {"session_type": {"length": "00:25", "id": 380, "name": "Talk"}, "short_abstract": "<p>A smattering of updates from the exciting world of Ethereum with Proof of Stake, ICOs, name services, halal currencies, and dapps.\u00a0 Conveniently, for attendees Ethereum Research is based in Singapore (SGInnovate) and we are seeking research interns.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "Technologist mixing novel technology and social insight to solve hard problems.

The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. You get the best of both worlds while working with Cython: Python like syntax with blazing fast C speed. This talk/tutorial by a Python/Cython developer introduces Cython programming language and leads the participants all the way from their first Python extension to an efficient integration with native C. Topics covered will be: 1. Using the Cython compiler to build a native extension module 2. Cython development from Jupyter notebook 3. Mixing Python with static C types in the Cython language 4. Calling into native code from Cython code (Brief introduction) 5. Wrap up: A brief case study Cyvlfeat: A Cython/Python wrapper for Computer Vision library, VLFeat. Participants are expected to have a good understanding of the Python language, some basic knowledge about C or C++. No deep C programming knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about writing extension modules for the CPython runtime.</i></p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>Simmi is on a mission to promote the Python programming language to facilitate the growth of a diverse community of Python Ninjas.

At Go-Jek, we were seeing requests being raised at rates of more than 15 adhoc tasks per week. We decided to bring it down to less than 3 per week.The requests received by systems team belonged to 7 broad categories. For instance, requests included tasks like setting up services, increasing disk size, fixing master-slave db replication, etc. Most tasks can be handled by users themselves. Hence we decided to build `Proctor` to help us automate repetitive and manual tasks.We had 3 requirements:- Users should be able to automate any job (in any language of their preference)- Handle requests of running a job in a sandbox environment and report its status- Have a simple and documented interface to run a jobThe design we took ended up with 3 components independent of each other. The components are as follows:1. `Automation scripts reservoir`- A user adds a script( in any language, having any dependency)- Review every script by security- Package script and dependencies into an image during CI; and push it to internal artifactory2. `Service to handle jobs`- A web service which handles submission and reporting of jobs- Authorization is handled by this service- This service runs jobs in relevant kubernetes cluster- All configuration and secrets required by a job (inside packaged image) are managed by this service3. `Client to run jobs`- A client (CLI tool) to run jobs using the web service- All parameters required by the job are managed by the clientAs an end result, users can automate any task, manage its configuration in the server and run it using the client.This talk will revolve around how the design of `Proctor` evolved over time with feedback from users; challenges faced; what impact it had on Go-Jek; and the future of `Proctor` (hint: we're open sourcing it soon).</p>", "slides": "", "state": "accepted", "microlocation": {"id": 639, "name": "Event Hall 1-1"}, "end_time": "2018-03-25T16:55:00+08:00", "video": null, "audio": null, "signup_url": null, "id": 4397, "long_abstract": ""}, {"session_type": {"length": "00:25", "id": 380, "name": "Talk"}, "short_abstract": "<p>In this presentation, we would like to show audiences some information related upgrade in microservices system like below:</p><ul><li>What is microservices system?</li><li>Some related mechanisms to upgrade such as blue-green and canary.

It is easy to forget that neither of these models was obvious at the dawn of computing; they both had to be invented, and they're not the only ways to do it. The good news is that developing F/OSS is not intrinsically incompatible with making a living, people have been doing it for decades.

Programmers can use any of three kinds of languages to develop applications: C/C++, Java and HTML/JS. Elastos is different from an Android-like OS in at least four aspects:1. Elastos has a complete set of novel C/C++ APIs and frameworks, which correspond to the Java APIs and frameworks of Android. With better performance and a smaller footprint, Elastos is a better fit for embedded systems and machines with wireless peripherals. Elastos also supports almost all Android Java and JS APIs and frameworks. POSIX APIs are deprecated.2. Elastos has a distributed OS runtime to guarantee end-to-end security and integrity across the Internet. With built-in metadata-driven reflection technology, Elastos can automatically generate code to bridge programming modules across languages and machine boundaries. In other words, applications, services and IoT devices are prohibited from sending/receiving network packets directly, in order to fence off network attacks initiated from third party software and hardware.3. Elastos runtime has a pioneering, service-oriented architecture, designed ideally for containers/virtual-machines. An Elastos runtime can be thought of as a CppVM (vs. JavaVM) without a leaking bottom, i.e., there are no Java-Native-Interface (JNI) equivalent mechanisms to expose the underlying physical machine or host OS. This prevents the possibility of malicious code penetrating into the system layer.4.

This work was done during a research internship at CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography. We worked with datasets provided by the field work and underwater explorations in the Arabian Sea along Western Coast of India. In this project, the traditional image restoration approach is extended by incorporating underwater optical properties into the system response function. Underwater turbidity causes loss of clarity transparency, visibility and the luminosity in underwater images to study a particular scene for Marine Archeologists. In this project, we have implemented and compared different methods of underwater image enhancement and restoration which are degraded by the turbidity in water. We implemented the various image processing algorithms considering an average quality camera (i.e., Logitech C920). The algorithms implemented in a step-wise manner are preprocessing, filtering, enhancement and denoising based on a model. Images tend to get degraded as the depth and turbidity increases, the amount of light on objects decreases and light distribution becomes nonuniform. To tackle this issue, the input images are converted to YCbCr color space and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is performed on the Luminescence(Y) channel of the image which improves the local contrast, at the same time limiting the amplification which can over-amplify the noise too.\u00a0The filtering and enhancement were done using the Bilateral Filter and then finally the enhancement was carried out using the wavelet denoising method and de-blurring. Due to the intensity variations involved in underwater sensing, denoising is carefully carried out by wavelet decompositions. This is necessary to explore different effects of restoration constraints, and especially their response to an underwater environment where the effects of scattering can be easily treated as either signal or noise.</p><p>Since our solution aided the marine archeologists in their studies, we gave more emphasis to the information extraction and the visibility of features rather than the enhancing the physical features of the underwater images.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "Pronnoy Goswami is currently working with McKinsey and Company as a Software Development Engineer.

Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 and have a $500 travel stipend available to them.

LDAP is a standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. I am helping Fedora improve the Directory Servers Python command line tools. In addition to this, the team at Fedora is also investigating into integrating existing C code with Rust (watch here: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline;\">Integrating Rust with existing C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">) to improve performance and maintainability.

My first task was to add the command line support for automember plugin to the Directory Server. Automembership allows a static group to act like a dynamic group, for adding new members to the group. Different automembership definitions create searches that are automatically run on all new directory entries. The automembership rules search for and identify matching entries and then explicitly add those entries as members to the group. I started by added the classes (Auto Membership Plugin, Auto Member Definition, Auto Member Definitions), methods and the tests for these classes and methods (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline;\">Pull Request</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">). Then I added the support for automember by command line which included creating, removing, editing and showing the automember definitions. This included writing the tests as well. By the end of this task, I learnt about Python decorators, lazy evaluation in Python, using pytest testing tool and writing command line parser and arguments using the argparse library. (This will be shown with live coding and screenshots).</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">I am currently working on another task which involves building an LRU cache in Rust which stores C allocated strings and can retrieve them. This project will be built using the meson build system. I will also provide tests and asan builds. This task will act as a proof of concept for investigating if meson can replace autotools as the Directory Server build system. During this task, I hope to learn about build systems, LRU caching concept and Rust types and safety.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">As you can deduce from my tasks and the key learnings, doing this Outreachy internship with Fedora is helping me to stand at the forefront of technology, learning about LDAP, Python and Rust (polyglot!), which will definitely enable me to become a better programmer and a collaborative community member for Fedora.

However, a few simple concepts can simplify this problem. The main challenge, as mentioned, with collaborative editing is the concurrency control [<strong>concurrent edits</strong>] to the document are not commutative. This needs to be causally ordered before applying either by undoing history or by transforming the operations [<strong>operational transformation</strong>] before applying them to make them seem commutative.</p><p></p>Bringing Latency into\u00a0action<p></p><p>Introducing latency between the client and server is where the problems arise. Latency in a <span>collaborative</span> editor introduces the possibility of version conflicts. Here, where, I said Operational Transformation will come into action.</p><p></p><p>Let\u2019s take an example\u00a0:</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Client\u2019s state\u00a0:</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Server\u2019s state\u00a0:</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p>Now, let\u2019s say, <em>Client</em> enters X in between C and D\u00a0, the operation would look something like this\u00a0:</p><p></p><p>insert(X,3) //where 3 is the position where x is going to be added (0=A, 1=B, 2=C\u00a0..)</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, <em>Server</em> deletes,b the operation would be\u00a0:</p><p></p><p>delete(B,1)</p><p></p><p>What actually should happen is that the client and server should both end with ACXD but in reality, <em>client</em> ends with ACXD</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [remote] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>but the <em>server</em> ends with acdx.</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [remote] -&gt; ACDX<p></p><p>Of course, ACXD\u00a0!= ACDX and the document which is shared now is in the wrong state.</p><p></p><p>Here is where the <strong>Operational Transformation</strong> algorithm comes to the rescue.</p><p></p>Operational Transformation Algorithm<p></p><p>Operational Transformation (OT) is an algorithm/technique for the transformation of operations such that they can be applied to documents whose states have diverged, bringing them both back to the same state.</p><p></p>How does Operational Transformation work?<p></p><p>A short overview of how OT works\u00a0:</p><p></p><ul><li>Every change (insertion or deletion) is represented as an <strong>operation</strong>. An operation can be applied to the current document which results into a new document state.</li><li>To handle concurrent operations, we use the <strong>tranform</strong> function that takes two operations that have been applied to the same document state (but on different clients) and computes a new operation that can be applied after the second operation and that preserves the first operation\u2019s intended change.</li></ul><p></p><p>Let\u2019s apply Operational Transformation in the original example.</p><p></p><p>If we apply OT, <em>Client</em> will see\u00a0:</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>and <em>Server</em> will see\u00a0:</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 2 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD //Transform function would add add it in the new (3 - 1 = 2) position<p></p>Client \u2014 Server [OT] Approach to Collaborative Editing<p>The <strong>transform</strong> function is used to build a client-server protocol that can handle collaboration between any number of clients.</p><p>Choosing a Client-Server architecture will allow scouting a large number of clients without actually complicating the environment. Also, there will be a single system which holds the source of truth i.e. the server, so even if the clients crash/go offline for a long time, we can go back to the server and fetch the document easily.</p><p>This source of truth also forces the client to wait for the server to <strong>acknowledge</strong> the operation that the client has just sent which would mean that the client always stays on the server\u2019s OT path. This would help in keeping a single history of operations without actually having to keep a mirror of the state for each client that is connected. That would eventually mean the number of clients that are connected to the server would have only one single copy of the document on the server.</p><p></p>Conclusion<p></p><p><strong>Operational Transformation</strong>\n is a very powerful tool that allows to build great collaborative apps \nwith support for non-blocking concurrent editing. I am looking forward \nto dive deep into the algorithm (and ofcourse extending this blogpost) \nand possibly working on an editor which supports it as well.</p><p></p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "Srijan is a Computer Science Engineering junior.

The operation mode can be used on non/synchronous LTE satellite station, and satellite communication authentication with IMSI code for IoT cubic satellite. If the LTE signal is accessible, and authorized to talk, the data will be sent through. The LTE ground station will be the gateway, and downlink to the ground.

Similar to the time when graphic user interfaces for the web - the browsers - became popular, we see again a race among predominantly proprietary systems to capture the personal assistant and VUI market. A few Open Source players on the market exist as well. They are often focusing on providing solutions for a niche, using front-end technologies or support the skill creation. They often depend on proprietary components to provide their service. Another development is the implementation of chatbot applications and voice interfaces as an add-on to existing services, apps, IoT, robots, machines as well as cars and even in airplanes. Very few approaches to create intelligent Open Source backends that can be used for internal company services exist. The question is: Just like with the GUI browser web, will openness prevail in the VUI Conversational Web as well? What are the incentives to go open? Is there pressure from the consumer market similar to the browser market? Will we have more mixed solutions? What are the requirements of consumers and producers for cars or airplanes? Is there an argument in regards to security and the danger of connected services that cannot be evaluated? Other questions on the panel are about technologies, architectures and standardization for example of APIs. Lastly we want to talk about the business aspects: What income models exist for such services? How could Open Source startups attract funding and clients? In which niches would Open Source conversational solutions have an advantage? What would be advantages if we consider using the power of the community of creating skills in wiki like platforms and companies making use and collaborating with the community?</span></p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>Michael is the founder of SUSI AI, loklak and, the creator of the Peer-to-Peer Search engine YaCy.

Even more so when we consider the eCommerce industry. In every corner of the world, eCommerce companies are vying to capture the market share. As a result, companies are required to provide processes and infrastructure to allow data access to Business Intelligence and Development teams without compromising on regulatory requirements. To solve this problem, there is some commercially available software which encrypts data at rest by using key management within or outside the RDBMS.

There is already\na lot of usage of digital money, for example when a person makes a transaction\nthe system identifies the person and makes credit equivalent to the amount of\ndeposit, which makes it digitally usable on ATM machines or in transfer from\nperson to person or can be utilized to purchase goods or services. But this is\nnot related to concept of digital currencies because a digital currency is more\nlike a real form of currency with a characteristic of independence i.e. free\nfrom intermediaries such as central banks. Hence the whole system of digital\ncurrency is decentralized and there is no decision making involved by\npoliticians or governments or banks. Such as Bit coins work through\ncryptographic algorithms to make the currency digitally usable. There are people who like the idea of currency which does\nnot involve people in grey suits i.e. bankers and politicians who have had the\nsystem under control until now.

These commands will have an effect. Functional languages like Haskell, OCaml revolve around the concept of 'pure functions'. A pure function is expressed as a mathematical expression only. You can evaluate the expression and there will be no side effects, for example, no I/O operations, no global state changes, no database interactions. The output is only dependent on its inputs. Hence, it is based on \u2018equational reasoning\u2019. So if you were to call a pure function with the same inputs a million times, you would get the same result every single time. Since there are no side effects, there is immutable data.</p><p>The data once initialized remains same throughout the lifetime of the code, which makes 'parallel programming' easier. Due to this immutability of data, the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program \u2013 as long as the required variables are defined. This is termed as 'Referential Transparency'. It means that the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program \u2013 as long as the required variables are defined. You never need to track the value of state variables or remember any updates. This enables usage of 'memoization' \u2013 you basically \u2018remember\u2019 the outputs of expensive functions with some common arguments in a sort of lookup table. This reduces the computational complexity at the expense of memory.</p><p>Functions are dealt as 'first-class citizens', i.e, you can treat them as any other objects \u2013 you can assign them to variables, you can pass them as arguments, or even get them returned from other functions. 'Recursion' is the most important aspect of functional programming, since there are no loops (which prevents any side effects). 'Higher order functions' like map(), reduce() and filter() can take functions as arguments (or return them as results), providing parallelism over sequences. Partial function application, 'currying' and 'lazy evaluation' prevents loading entire data at once into the memory. All these features provide the advantage of code re-usability, less bugs, easy testing and parallelism. </p><p>This talk will acquaint the audience with functional programming features and why is it a hot topic today.</p><p>Last 5 minutes would be left for any questions.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>I am a Master of Science ( Computer Science) student at University of Melbourne.

Especially when you have to cater to umpteen users using umpteen different OSs and ecosystems. Users may have very old version of a specific library that they are not ready to upgrade because some legacy application still depends on that. Or they have a latest version of a Ruby gem with which your application will not work, yet. All this can cause a bad experience for the users, and hence never ending flow of bug reports for developers. All of this in addition to the trouble it takes to properly document what all dependencies your software depends on, what order they has to be installed, to which all locations and what files should have what permission etc etc.With full stack installers, you no longer have that problem. You provide a batteries included package to the users, which they can install using the OS package managers that they are familiar with. It basically includes whatever bells and whistles your software need to work - without users even having to look under the hood.Omnibus is a full stack installer creator from Chef, the developers of automation solutions (Hence the food/kitchen reference in talk title. :D ). It lets you create installers/packages of your application for common OSs - Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS, Mac OS, Windows etc. In this talk, I cover the basic concepts of full stack installers, their pros and cons and then a quick dive into the working of omnibus along with a basic idea of Chef. I talk about what the components of omnibus are, how Chef plays a key role in the whole setup and share a few pointers on how you can use omnibus to ship your applications without much hassle.</p>", "slides": "", "state": "accepted", "microlocation": {"id": 626, "name": "Training room 4-1"}, "end_time": "2018-03-24T14:25:00+08:00", "video": null, "audio": null, "signup_url": null, "id": 4417, "long_abstract": ""}]
